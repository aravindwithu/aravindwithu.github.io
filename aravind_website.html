				  <h3>Welcome to my website,</h3>
				  <p>
				  	My name is Aravind, I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science. I am actively looking for new opportunities. While I have a strong background in Computer Science, my emphasis is on Software Engineering, Web development and Cloud Computing and Architecture.
				  </p>
				  <p>
				  	I have extensive experience in the software and web technologies covering all phases of project. Further, I am a good team player, deterministic and reliable in getting the job done in time. My recent internship in a start-up thought me how to work independently and productively. Throughout my experience as a software developer, I learnt how to handle multiple task effectively by prioritizing each task and have in-depth understanding of given task with all the relevant data & inputs. Recently scored 2nd place in advanced cloud computing course work, which boosted my confidence and my interest in field of cloud computing and architecture.
				  </p>
				  <p>
				  	To take up a job and to finish it in time with all required attributes as well as attention to all the required details requires discipline of a leader and I believe, I possess the same quality. Moreover, in my previous employment I had wonderful opportunity to interact directly with customers and to solve their problems with complete satisfaction. In my home town I have hosted tech symposiums and regular events to promote coding habits among future generations, form which I have learned how to conduct & manage events effectively, to handle different people with different perspectives and also it provided me with tutorship opportunities.
				  </p>
				  <P>
				  	As I said all, I am confident that I can perform any given job with at most dedication. Please feel free to call me at <span style="color:red">(607) 232-9492</span> and email me at <a href="mailto:avenkit2@binghamton.edu">avenkit2@binghamton.edu</a>. Thank you for your time—I look forward to learning more about the available opportunities!
				  </P>
				  <p>
				  	<br/>
				  	Sincerely,
				  	<br/>
